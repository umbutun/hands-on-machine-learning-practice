# 🎰 Chapter 5 — Support Vector Machines


### ⅀ Overview
This notebook introduces **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, a family of robust margin-based algorithms for classification and regression.  
You’ll learn how kernel methods project data into higher dimensions to make it linearly separable.

---

### ⎇ Key Topics
- Hard-margin vs soft-margin SVM  
- Polynomial and RBF kernels  
- Kernel trick and feature space intuition  
- Hyperparameters `C` and `gamma`  
- SVM Regression (SVR)  

---

### 🕯️ Notebook Highlights
- Visualized decision boundaries under different kernels  
- Compared SVC and SVR results  
- Explored how margin width affects generalization  
- Performed grid-search hyperparameter tuning
