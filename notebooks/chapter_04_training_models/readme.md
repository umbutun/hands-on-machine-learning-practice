# 📘 Chapter 4 — Training Models

---

### 🧭 Overview
This notebook explores the **core algorithms** behind linear and polynomial regression, focusing on how optimization and regularization influence model performance.  
You’ll experiment with gradient descent variants and visualize how models learn over time.

---

### 🗝️ Key Topics
- Linear and polynomial regression  
- Batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent  
- Learning-rate tuning and feature scaling  
- Regularization: Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net  
- Early stopping for overfitting control  

---

### 💡 Notebook Highlights
- Implemented regression models from scratch  
- Compared learning behaviors of different optimizers  
- Demonstrated impact of regularization on bias–variance trade-off  
- Visualized cost-function convergence and learning curves
