# 📘 Chapter 6 — Decision Trees


### 🧭 Overview
This notebook covers **Decision Trees**, a simple yet powerful family of models that make hierarchical, interpretable decisions.  
You’ll learn to visualize trees, tune their complexity, and interpret feature importances.

### 🗝️ Key Topics
- Gini impurity and entropy  
- Tree construction and information gain  
- Pruning and max-depth constraints  
- Decision Tree Regression  
- Feature importance evaluation
