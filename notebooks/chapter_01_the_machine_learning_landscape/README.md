# 🧠 Chapter 1 — The Machine Learning Landscape

### 📚 Overview
This chapter introduces the core ideas behind Machine Learning — what it is, why it matters, and how it differs from traditional programming.  
It outlines the main types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), common challenges like overfitting and underfitting, and a quick tour of the end-to-end ML workflow.
