# 🧠 Chapter 1 — The Machine Learning Landscape


### 📚 Overview
This chapter introduces the core ideas behind Machine Learning — what it is, why it matters, and how it differs from traditional programming.  
It outlines the main types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), common challenges like overfitting and underfitting, and a quick tour of the end-to-end ML workflow.

### 🧩 Key Topics
- Machine Learning definitions and categories  
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning  
- Reinforcement learning overview  
- Batch vs. online learning  
- Instance-based vs. model-based learning  
- Major challenges: data quality, overfitting, underfitting
