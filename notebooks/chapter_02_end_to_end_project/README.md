# 🏠 Chapter 2 — End-to-End Machine Learning Project

### 📚 Overview
This chapter applies the full ML process to a **California housing price prediction** project.  
It covers data exploration, feature engineering, transformations, pipelines, and model evaluation.  
By the end, you’ll have a complete predictive model and a reproducible workflow.
