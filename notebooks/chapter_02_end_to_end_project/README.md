# 🏠 Chapter 2 — End-to-End Machine Learning Project

### 📚 Overview
This chapter applies the full ML process to a **California housing price prediction** project.  
It covers data exploration, feature engineering, transformations, pipelines, and model evaluation.  
By the end, you’ll have a complete predictive model and a reproducible workflow.

---

### 🧩 Key Topics
- Problem framing and data understanding  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Feature scaling and transformation  
- Pipelines and preprocessing steps  
- Model training, validation, and fine-tuning  
- Cross-validation and grid search  

---

### 🧮 Notebook Highlights
- Full end-to-end ML pipeline with Scikit-Learn  
- Feature engineering (log transformations, bins, custom transformers)  
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation  
- Reproducibility through pipeline encapsulation
