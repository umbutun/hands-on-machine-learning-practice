# 🌳 Chapter 7 — Ensemble Learning and Random Forests


### 💧 Overview
This notebook explores the concept of **ensemble learning**, where multiple models collaborate to produce stronger, more stable predictions.  
You’ll implement **voting**, **bagging**, **pasting**, and **Random Forests**, analyzing their impact on variance and bias.

### 🎹 Key Topics
- Voting classifiers  
- Bagging and pasting methods  
- Random Forests and feature randomness  
- Out-of-Bag (OOB) evaluation  
- Feature importance interpretation  

---

### 🌈 Notebook Highlights
- Compared ensemble methods to single models  
- Implemented bagging and random forests using Scikit-Learn  
- Analyzed OOB scores vs. validation results  
- Explored forest-level feature importances
